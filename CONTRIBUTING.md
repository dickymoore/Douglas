# Contributing to Douglas

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome improvements via issues and pull requests. Please ensure compliance with our coding standards and provide tests for new features.

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Make your changes and add tests.
- Ensure all tests pass and run `ruff check`, `black --check`, and `isort --check-only` so formatting matches the automated guard checks.
- Submit a pull request; we use conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:` prefixes).

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities.
