# ${project_name}

This project was bootstrapped with [Douglas](${douglas_readme_url}).

## Quickstart

1. Run `codex login` to authenticate via your browser (Codex is the default provider).
2. (Optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you plan to provide tokens manually.
3. Create a virtual environment with `make venv`.
4. Run the tests with `make test`.
5. Start iterating with `douglas run` once you're ready.

Refer to the Douglas README for detailed documentation and advanced workflows.
